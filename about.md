## About

Natural language processing (NLP) has been revolutionized by the advancement of deep learning, which have enabled large-scale language models. However, state-of-the-art models are still supervised via large datasets, whether labeled or not. In this survey class, we will focus on the datasets behind language technologies. Starting with dataset creation methodologies, we will survey widely used datasets in NLP, and some of their key characteristics, essential for learning. The course will describe how biases arising from creation methodologies might inadvertently lead to models that perform exceedingly well within some data distributions, but do not generalize to other distributions, as well as how these biases can be addressed. We will also explore some literature on how the quality of datasets can be estimated automatically, contextualized via data sheets, and broadly within the existing literature on data ethics. Finally, we will look at some extensions of the above concepts to unlabeled datasets, as well as datasets with modalities beyond language.

## Pre-Requisites

You must have taken undergraduate and/or graduate level classes in either Machine Learning or Natural language Processing, equivalent to CSCI 544 (Applied Natural Language Processing) or CSCI 567 (Machine learning), respectively. Please email the instructor for special circumstances or for specific clarifications.

## Assignments


Grades will be based on paper presentations (20%), discussion (15%), and a final project (65% total).



##### Paper presentations (20%)
Students will be expected to present 1-2 research papers and lead class discussion on these papers. The presentation format should ideally involve slide decks designed to help everyone in the class understand the papers. The presenter should also prepare a few discussion questions to encourage discussion after the presentation.

##### Class participation (15%)
Students are expected to participate in class discussions by not only asking questions, but also sharing their opinions on the topics under discussion. Students are also expected to turn in quiz sheets filled based on small group discussions.

##### Final project (65% total)
Students must individually or in teams of two (at maximum) complete a final research project on a topic related to the class. This project is expected to include novel research on either (1) building analytical tools for investigating large-scale datasets, or (2) replicating tools from prior research to apply on new datasets. Please come to office hours or email me if you have questions related to choosing a project direction.



- <em>Project proposal (5%).</em> Students should submit a ~2-page proposal for their project by the end of Week 5. The proposal should motivate the project, and situate it within related work, to the best of the students’ abilities.

- <em>Project progress report (10%).</em> Students should submit a ~5-page progress report for their project by the end of Week 10. This should once again describe the project’s goals (it is okay if this has changed since the proposal), initial results, and a concrete plan of what will be done for the final report. While the initial results might be inconclusive, students are expected to have made non-trivial progress by this point. The project proposal may be repurposed for this report.

- <em>Project final presentation (20%).</em> This will be a 20-30 minute presentation during the last two / three weeks of class. If in teams of two, each student must present an equal share of the work. Students should describe the motivation for their work, relevant background material, and their own findings, as well as address audience questions.

- <em>Project final report (30%).</em> Students should submit a ~8-page final report detailing all aspects of their project. The report should be structured like a conference paper, including an abstract, introduction, related work, and experiments (standard *ACL paper submission template); a tech report format is discouraged. Parts of the proposal and progress report may be reused for the final report. Negative results will not be penalized, but should be accompanied with detailed analysis of why the proposed method did not work as anticipated.

All written assignments related to the final project should use the standard *ACL paper submission template.
